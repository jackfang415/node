In this assignment, we are using node to grab different objects from different databases. We had to obtain the tweets from twitter,the song of our choice from spotify, and movies from omdb. There was a lot of setup involved for this assignment such as creating different files to store keys and our code. We also had to create a gitignore file to prevent unncessary files being pushed to the master branch. The code that was stored in liri.js had the functions to call a song, movie, tweets, and one that would be able to read a random text file to activate a a command of our choice.
